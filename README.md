# OpenCDA
opencda version=0.0.1

# ** Warning **
This library isn't meant for performance (100% pythonic), but it gets the job done :D
Now it is abandoned, this is just an archive for myself.

OpenCDA stands for open complex-data-analysis.
It's a library for manipulating complex-data and analysis (still not implemented)
